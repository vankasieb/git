DESCRIPTION:Splunk is the most popular operational data intelligence platf
 orm. Organizations use Splunk to collect\, parse and index petabyte scale 
 machine data. Splunk is used in IT operations\, business analytics and SIE
 M (security information and events management). It provides a versatile qu
 ery language (Search Processing Language or SPL) and rich set of visualiza
 tions that help users make sense of their machine data in numerous ways.\n
 While Splunk is an extremely powerful platform\, there is a learning curve
  for most users to fully understand its various features. Not learning the
  correct techniques can lead to inaccurate results and missing out on time
 -saving short-cuts. In this training session\, users will learn the most e
 ffective techniques to make use of their machine data using Splunk. Studen
 ts will be able to apply the techniques they learn immediately in their ow
 n environment.\n\n\nGo to the event (https://learning.oreilly.com/live-tra
